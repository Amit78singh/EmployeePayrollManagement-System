# IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - NO MORE HANGING

## Problem
Backend API keeps hanging and not starting properly, preventing real data access.

## SOLUTION
Use IIS Express or simple console app approach instead of dotnet run.

## Steps:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Set EmployeePayrollAPI as startup project
3. Press F5 or Ctrl+F5 to run
4. This will start on https://localhost:7108 automatically

## Alternative - Manual Start:
```cmd
cd EmployeePayrollAPI
dotnet build
dotnet bin\Debug\net8.0\EmployeePayrollAPI.dll --urls "https://localhost:7108"
```

## Frontend Changes Made:
✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors in dashboard
✅ Removed all mock data
✅ Dashboard now uses real API calls for:
   - Employee count and salary totals
   - Real attendance data from database
   - Real leave requests from database

## What's Working Now:
- Frontend compiles without errors
- Dashboard component uses real API services
- All mock data removed
- Proper error handling in place

## Next Step:
Start the backend using Visual Studio (F5) instead of command line to avoid hanging issues.
